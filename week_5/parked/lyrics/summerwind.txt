I'm still parked out by the lake
Eighty miles from Santa Fe
And I'm sittin' here just parked out by the lake

If you're wonderin' where I parked
I'm out parked by the lake
It's the lake that's eighty miles from Santa Fe

And I'm parked out by the lake
Eighty miles from Santa Fe
It's the lake that's parked where I'm at out by the lake
And this lake is where I'm parked
Eighty miles from Santa Fe
And I'm still parked out here by this lake
Eighty miles from Santa Fe

Do you remember that old lake
The one by Santa Fe
That's where I'm at I'm sitting out here parked

And I'm parked here by the lake
Eighty miles from Santa Fe
And it's the lake that you remember where I park

And I'm parked out by the lake
Eighty miles from Santa Fe
It's the lake that's parked where I'm at out by the lake
And this lake is where I'm parked
Eighty miles from Santa Fe
And I'm still parked out here by this lake
Eighty miles from Santa Fe

And someday
I'm gonna move
But right now I'm parked
And you know that lake out by
Santa Fe, that's where I'm at, I'm parked
Waitin' for you

And you know that I'm parked out by the lake
You remember that lake out by Santa Fe
And I'm gonna sit here parked
Out by this lake
Out by this lake
By the lake at Santa Fe

I'm sittin' out here parked
It's where I told you how I felt
By the lake in Santa Fe
